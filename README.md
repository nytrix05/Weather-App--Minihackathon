WeatherApp 


It allows you to see the most important informations about the current Weather at different locations. I did not have enough time, to build something more beautiful, but I am happy that i could work the first time with an API. Thank you, for letting me participate in your first Hackathon.


I did build it with Kivy in Python. 
for testing purposes you need to install the following packages:

pip install openmeteo-requests
pip install requests-cache
pip install requests
pip install kivy
